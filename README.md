# DigiStore
A solution for local bakeries to compete with larger food &amp; beverage services and survive better. This would be done by optimising their processes via digitalisation.

# This project has just started and is still underway. 
The current idea is to help local bakeries reduce cost in operations. <br>
This would be done by optimising their process via digitalisation. Currently, we are designing and creating a multi-platform website to accommodate multiple bakeries. <br>
Our mindset in creating this project is to help local bakeries stand in the face of online competition from bigger food & beverage services and survive. <br>
We start off by optimising the process of one bakery - U May Delight.

# How it goes 
Bakeries interested in moving their business online can look for us to smoothen that process. An individual, specially designed website would be created for these bakery owners. <br> 
Features of the website include online shopping of the bakery's products, automatic inventory stock take, costs profits and pricing predictions, visual graphics to better understand their bakery's services and many more.

# Why should bakeries choose us
With the ongoing COVID-19 happening around the world, the importance of transferring services online became imperative among many. However, digitalising services is not easy and often costly. From the point of view of these bakery owners, they do not have the edge as compared to other online food & beverage service, hence often face problems of shutting down due to not being able to compete with them. Therefore, we want to make this possible for our local bakeries to survive in this intense competition against the bigger food & beverage services who have the ability for larger expenses. Our web application service would be free of charge (at the start) and increases as it scales bigger. Overall, costs of our service would be mainly borne by us, as an initiative to help these local bakeries survive better.
